        "description": "Introducing the absolutely delicious clone of the legendary \"Even Sharks Need Water\" by Verdant - a New England IPA that is sure to tantalize your taste buds. Bursting with Galaxy and Citra hops, this brew is a hop lover's dream come true. The aroma is a sensory delight with tropical fruit, citrus and floral notes that give way to a smooth, silky mouthfeel. The flavor profile is complex, with an initial burst of juicy citrus followed by a subtle bitterness that lingers long after the last sip. This brew is a true homage to the New England style, with a hazy, yellow appearance that hints at the unfiltered goodness within.",
